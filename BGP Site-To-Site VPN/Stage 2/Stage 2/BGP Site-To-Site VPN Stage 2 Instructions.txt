Objective

Create two VPN attachments for the transite gateway and the transit
gateway already exists. Select accelerated VPN options which means
that AWS will create acclerated VPN endpoints, two per connection.
Those supply transit back to the transite gateway over the AWS global
network. The process creates VPN connections which can be used to 
connect the accelerated VPN endpoints to the on premises routers 
using IPsec tunnels two per connection. This stage the AWS side 
will be configured.
