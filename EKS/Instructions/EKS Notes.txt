Created Master Node with group nodes (worker nodes). 

First I provision an EKS cluster
Second deploy worker nodes
Third connect to EKS
Fourth Run Kubernetes apps

I ran into an error as you can tell. The error needed me to upgrade
my AWS CLI to run the kubectl command. Once upgraded the command
runs correctly.
